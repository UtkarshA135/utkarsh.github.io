Windows 11 is new in the market - but doesn't run on my PC (●'◡'●) .
 No worries , I made my own in form of a portfolio - two shots in one :D

So presenting to you all , a unique portfolio ,with the theme of Windows 11

## Features -

With a tiring one week effort here it is -
- A Windows 11 styled animated background with sleek ease in animation for tabs .
- Real Time digital clock and date
- Spotify - to tune you up while visiting my portfolio
- Chrome - ya you can surf as well
- Vs code basic extension

#### Wondering where's the portfolio then -
#### Guess what ? What do developers love the most - yay !! Its Command Prompt
#### Find my complete portfolio in the cmd 
#### use the commands like cd , ls 
#### !-- Note  If the Cmd does'nt load try refresing the webiste once & also some icons are static ,working on them :))---!
